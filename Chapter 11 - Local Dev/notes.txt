Only main packages will have main function

Package naming

By convention, a package's name is the same as the last element of its import path.
For instance, the math/rand package comprises files that begin with:
`package rand`



A directory of Go code can have at most one package. All .go files in a single directory must all belong to the same package.



Go module

Go programs are organized into packages. A package is a directory of Go code that's all compiled together.
Functions, types, variables, and constants defined in one source file are visible to all other source files within the same package (directory)

A repository contains one or more modules. A module is a collection of go packages that are released together.



The `go run` command is used to quickly compile and run a Go package.

Use `go build`instead to compile production executables

The use of go run its to quickly do some testing or debugging

Or just use make to fast and easy things


`go install` is good to compile our code then install it globally in our computer so we can do hellogo in this example globally


Custom package
